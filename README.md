DEMO VID: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9AwxClY3g

TEST APK: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/ca.fuwafuwa.kaku

DB FILES: http://fuwafuwa.ca/f/JGBWH1MMvv.zip

Installation instructions:

1. Install the application - do not attempt to launch the application, it will crash
2. Unzip the file from fuwafuwa.ca and put it into your phone's storage
3. Move everything from the extracted zip to /Android/data/ca.fuwafuwa.kaku
4. Go to your phone's settings and find the setting "Draw over other apps" - enable that setting for Kaku (where the setting is depends on Android version, so you may have to Google this)
5. Launch Kaku and hopefully it should work - double tap to OCR

```
   For step 3, the directory structure on Android should look like:
   
   /Android/data/ca.fuwafuwa.kaku
   |
   -> /files
      |
      -> /screenshots
      |
      -> /tessdata
      |
      -> KanjiDict2.db
      |

```
